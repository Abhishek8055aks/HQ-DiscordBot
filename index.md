# Profile Management

Making a profile can help you be more efficient at checking your statistics and the next game from your region.

## Making a profile

You can make a profile by running `hq, profile`, a profile will be generated.

It will looks like this

![profile](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463179282420596746/481217855912673299/unknown.png)

## Modifying your profile

You can set your HQ Username by typing `hq, set username (your username)`

As an example: ![uu](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463179282420596746/481218465299169280/unknown.png)

You can also set your HQ region by typing `hq, set region` followed by the region code.

List of codes

| Code | Country       |
| ---- | ------------- |
| `us` | United States |
| `uk` | Great Britain |
| `de` | Germany       |
| `au` | Australia     |

For example: ![region](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463179282420596746/481220053174583297/unknown.png)

## Modifying your "hq, user" output

If you're an auth key donator, you also have an option to set some special stats on your `hq, user` output. Type `hq, set [perk] true` to enable or `hq, set [perk] false` to disable.

| Perk Name   | Code   | Description                             |
| ----------- | ------ | --------------------------------------- |
| Extra Lives | lives  | Shows your extra lives on your profile  |
| Streaks     | streak | Shows your streak stats on your profile |

If both are enabled, it should look something like this: ![awoo](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/463179282420596746/481224099356475401/unknown.png)
